## **Command: `/rtp`**

### Overview
The `/rtp` command randomly teleports a player to a solid block within the configured world and region, avoiding non-solid blocks such as water and air. The teleportation includes a countdown (default 5 seconds) during which the player is notified in the chat not to move. The command also displays the coordinates of the teleportation location in a title after teleportation.
